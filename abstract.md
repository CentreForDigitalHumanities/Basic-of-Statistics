# Abstract 

Data are becoming increasingly important in the humanities. 
In this one-day course, intended for researchers and teachers in the humanities, you will learn the basics of statistical data analysis. 
We start with basic concepts such as variation and probability, and will discuss the principles underlying statistical descriptions and analyses. 
You will learn how to describe statistical properties of data (centre, distribution), 
how to perform simple statistical tests, and what these tests tell us (significance, effect size, power). 
In addition you will learn how to find meaningful patterns amidst random variation in data (correlation, regression). 
Throughout the course you will learn to interpret and assess your statistical results. 
Moreover, you will learn to use R (and its companion RStudio) for the statistical computations and visualizations taught in this course.
