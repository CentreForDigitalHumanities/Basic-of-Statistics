# CDH training on Basics of Statistics

Dear participants, 
 
Thanks for participating in the tutorial on Basics of Statistics. Below we provide some additional information about the location, about COVID measures, about software that you need to install, reading materials, and more. 

## Location 

The training will be given "live" in the Living Lab Digital Humanities, which is located inside the University Library, Drift 27, Utrecht, room 0.32. 
(How to find that room? You need to walk past the library desk, past the journals, into the former chapel, turn left, past the book stacks, past the special collections, then turn left just before a flight of stairs downward, first room on the right).

## Test yourself

We kindly ask you to do a COVID19 self-test no older than 48 hours, and to check yourself for COVID19 symptoms (see <https://www.uu.nl/en/media/72635>), before coming to the training. 

## Bring your laptop

There will be 16 participants, and not enough computers in the room, so we kindly ask you to bring your own laptop computer. Essential software needs to be installed on the laptop BEFORE the training, so read on. 

## Software 

1. Install R from <https://www.R-project.org> (Download, full installation for your computer)

2. Install RStudio from <https://www.Rstudio.com> (Download, Desktop Free version for your computer)

3. Create a separate folder on your computer for this training, e.g. C:\\Hugo\\BOS (Windows) or ~/Hugo/BOS (Mac).

4. Start RStudio. The program will show three or four panels, most of which have multiple tabs.  

5. Download the following R script and save it in the folder you have prepared in step 3 above:   
   <https://github.com/hugoquene/CDH-BOS/BOS20211007prepare.R>

6. In RStudio, open the file you have saved in step 5 above (File, Open File...). The file will open in the top left panel of RStudio. 

7. In RStudio, go to the top left panel (where the R script is visible). Click on the word "Source" in the upper border. The R script will be "run" or executed from the source code in the file. This will install additional packages in R, and will report details of your installation. The script will produce output in the Console panel (lower left). Regular output is in black, warnings and errors are in red. 

8. If you are using a UU laptop, and if you encounter problems while installing R or RStudio or the additional packages (step 5), then please consult the following troubleshooting guide:   
   <https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/workshop-introduction-to-R-and-data/blob/master/installation.md>


## Self-study materials

* Before the training, have a look at this document, which contains a brief intro into R:   
   <https://hugoquene.github.io/emlar2020>

* Before and/or after the training, you may want to consult this open textbook, titled _Quantitative Methods and Statistics_, for background, explanations and R examples:    
   <https://hugoquene.github.io/QMS-EN>


## Materials during the training

We are still busy preparing some files that we will use during the training. These files will be available in the repository at   
<https://github.com/hugoquene/CDH-BOS>.

## Schedule

The schedule will be approximately as follows:

* 09:30-10:00  walk-in, setup   
* 10:00-11:00  session 1, lecture (KS)   
* 11:10-11:15  break   
* 11:15-12:45  session 2, R session (HQ)   
* 12:45-13:30  lunch   
* 13:30-14:30  session 3, lecture (HQ)   
* 14:30-14:45  break   
* 14:45-16:00  session 4, R session (KS)   

## DCU compensation

This paragraph only applies to academic teaching staff in the Faculty of Humanities. The Centre for Digital Humanities aims to promote digital literacy amongst staff-members and therefore compensates attendance to these courses in terms of DCU (teaching load units). This course (including preparation) counts for 8 hours, which is equal to 0.36 DCU (22 hours = 1 DCU). The DCU’s will be automatically settled with your department at the end of the course.

## Cancellation

If you are unable to attend, then please cancel your registration by sending an email to <CDH@uu.nl>, so that we can place another participant from the waiting list in your spot.

We look forward to see you next week!
