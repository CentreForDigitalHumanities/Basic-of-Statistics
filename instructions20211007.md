# CDH training on Basics of Statistics

Dear participants, 
 
Thanks for participating in the tutorial on Basics of Statistics. Below we provide some additional information about the location, about COVID measures, about software that you need to install, and reading materials. 

## Location 

The training will be given "live" in the Living Lab Digital Humanities, which is located inside the University Library, Drift 27, Utrecht, room 0.32. 
(How to find that room? You need to walk past the library desk, past the journals, into the former chapel, turn left, past the book stacks, past the special collections, then turn left just before a flight of stairs downward, first room on the right).

## Test yourself

We kindly ask you to do a COVID19 self-test no older than 48 hours, and to check yourself for COVID19 symptoms (see <https://www.uu.nl/en/media/72635>), before coming to the training. 

## Bring your laptop

There will be 16 participants, and not enough computers in the room, so we kindly ask you to bring your own laptop computer. Essential software needs to be installed on the laptop BEFORE the training, so read on. 

## Software 

1. Install R from <https://www.R-project.org> (Download, full installation for your computer)

2. Install RStudio from <https://www.Rstudio.com> (Download, Desktop Free version for your computer)

3. Create a separate folder on your computer for this training, e.g. C:\\Hugo\\BOS2021 (Windows) or ~/Hugo/BOS2021 (Mac).

4. Start RStudio. The program will show four panels, each with multiple tabs. Go to the lower left panel, and click on the Console tab. 

5. In the Console panel, copy+paste the following command after the ">" prompt:   
   _source(file=url("https://github.com/hugoquene/CDH-BOS/BOS20211007prepare.R"))_   
This script will install additional packages in R, and will report details of your installation. The script will produce output in the same Console panel. Regular output is in black, warnings and errors are in red. 

6. If you are using a UU laptop, and if you encounter problems while installing R or RStudio or the additional packages (step 5), then please consult the following troubleshooting guide:
